    "## About Spatial Vector Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as **vertices** that define the \"shape\" of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working \n",
    "with. There are three types of vector data: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each \"bend\" in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and \"closed\". Thus, the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons. \n",

    "## Introduction to the Shapefile File Format Which Stores Points, Lines, and Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` \n",
    "format (`.shp`). Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are \n",
    "different, each individual shapefile can only contain one vector \n",
    "type (all points, all lines or all polygons). You will not find \n",
    "a mixture of point, line and polygon objects in a single shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated \n",
    "`attributes` that describe the data. For example, a line \n",
    "shapefile that contains the locations of streams might also\n",
    "contain the associated stream name, stream \"order\" and other \n",
    "information about each stream line object.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> **Data Tip:** More about shapefiles can found on \n",

    "\n",
    "## GeoJSON Files and Other Vector Formats\n",
    "The shapefile is not the only way that vector data are stored. Geospatial data \n",
    "can also be delivered in a \n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON\" target=\"_blank\">GeoJSON format</a>, \n",
    "or even a tabular format where the spatial information is contained in columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Data Are Stored In Spatial Vector Formats?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of data that often are provided in a vector format include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- census data including municipal boundaries\n",
    "- roads, powerlines and other infrastructure boundaries\n",
    "- political boundaries\n",
    "- building outlines\n",
    "- water bodies and river systems\n",

    "## Import Shapefile Data Into Python Using Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
