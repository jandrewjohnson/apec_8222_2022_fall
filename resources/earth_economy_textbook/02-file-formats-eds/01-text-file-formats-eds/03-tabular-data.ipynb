    "## What is Tabular Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data are data that are stored in a row / column format. Columns (and \n",
    "sometimes rows) are often identified by headers, which if named correctly, explain\n",
    "what is in that row or column. You may already be \n",
    "familiar with spreadsheet tools such as Excel and Google Sheets that can be \n",
    "used to open tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tabular Data Structure\n",
    "In the example below, you see a table of values \n",
    "that represent precipitation for 3 days. The headers in the data include \n",
    "\n",
    "* `day` and\n",
    "* `precipitation-mm`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| day   | precipitation-mm    |  \n",

    "| wednesday | 5 | \n",
    "\n",
    "The tabular data above contains 4 rows - the first of which (row 1) is a header row and subsequent rows contain data. The table also has 2 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Tabular Data File Types: .csv and .txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data can be downloaded in many different file formats. Spreadsheet formats \n",
    "include `.xls` and `xlsx` which can be directly opened in Microsoft \n",
    "Excel. When you are downloading Earth and Environmental data, you will often \n",
    "see tablular data stored in file formats including: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `.csv`: Comma Separated Values - This file has each column separated (delimited) by a comma. \n",
    "* `.txt`: A basic text file. In a `txt` file, often the delimiter (the thing that separates out each column) can vary. Delimiters are discussed below in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "These formats are text based and often can be opened in a text editor like Atom or Notepad. \n",
    "They can be then imported into **Python** using **Pandas** for further exploration \n",
    "and processing. \n",
