    "\n",
    "In **Python**, you can see the memory id of a variable using the `id()` function. This will print out a long integer that is how **Python** identifies the object. It's what **Python** uses to find the variable in the computer's memory. \n",

    "However, if you make a list by assigning it to the old list, a.k.a `list1 = list2`, they will both have the memory address of `list1`, `140657632719088`. This is because you were not creating a new variable, and thus making a new memory address. \n",
    "\n",
    "You were instead pointing to an old memory address when creating `list2`. Because of this, `list1 == list2` will return `True`, because their values are equal, AND `list1 is list2` will also return `True`, since they are stored at the same location.\n",
