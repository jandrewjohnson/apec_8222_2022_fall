For your convenience, I have included forks of our two textbooks in this repository. They are licensed under a creative-commons license that does not allow derivative works, so thus I leave them unmodified in their respective directories, but feel free to go to https://inferentialthinking.com and https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python for the live versions of their course.
