    "# R and Python: together\n",
    "\n",
    "One goal for this course was to ensure you see a variety of different tools for solving different problems. Often, different problems require different tools to address (e.g. R versus Python), so it is important to become multilingual. However, you might have your preference on which language you enjoy most. Or perhaps you inherited a large code-base written in a specific language and it would be hard to change. Fortunately, you don't actually have to choose!\n",
